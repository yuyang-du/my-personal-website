    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Yuyang Du</strong>, and I’ve always been someone who finds happiness in 
      the simple joys of life. Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed staying at home to watch 
      captivating dramas that transport me to different worlds, each story brimming with unique 
      characters and perspectives. This hobby continued to grow as I got older, and it’s now 
      something that truly enriches my day-to-day life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my other passions is cooking, especially for my cat <strong>Shu Tiao</strong>. While 
      she can’t eat the same meals I make for myself, I love researching cat-friendly recipes that 
      are both safe and appealing to her. There’s a special kind of satisfaction that comes from 
      seeing Shu Tiao sniff around the kitchen, eagerly waiting to taste something new. It might 
      sound a bit silly, but cooking for a pet can be a genuinely rewarding experience. I believe 
      that food brings people and animals closer together, even if we can’t share the exact same 
      dishes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this website to share my interests with friends, family, and anyone who stumbles 
      upon it. You’ll find photos, personal stories, and little tidbits about the things that 
      bring me joy. Whether it’s a new dish I’ve tried cooking or the latest drama that caught 
      my attention, I hope you find something here that resonates with you. Feel free to explore, 
      and thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and Shu Tiao!
